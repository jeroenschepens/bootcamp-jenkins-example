## Unlock Jenkins

After Jenkins has been installed in will open default on "http://localhost:8080"

Upon first run Jenkins will be locked and you will need to unlock it.

[../Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

### Change Port

If you don't want jenkins to run on 8080 or if another service you use runs on that port you can change it:

- find Jenkins.xml (in the install directory you choose in the wizard)
- search for "--httpPort=8080".
- replace 8080 with the desired port number
- restart jenkins (http://localhost:8080/safeRestart)
- alternatively you can start java on another port using "java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=8081" (or any other port)
