## create Unit Test job

[../Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

Now that our code compiles we would like to run some tests. For Maven we can request to perform a standard set of Unit tests. Other languages might have a different implementation

Go back to your Jenkins Dashboard if not already there.

Go to "New item".

Fix the java code until the job completes

Note: 
In order for jenkins to register your new code you need to edit the file locally, commit the changes and push them to your repository. 
Ask help from one of the instructors if you need
If you can't wait for help or can't figure out what went wrong you can follow the alternative Path

### Alternative Path

Alternatively you can change the branch in the job to one where we fixed the code for you

![alt text](/docs/images/Step3/Step3-alt-1.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Go to Source Code Management.

![alt text](/docs/images/Step3/Step3-alt-2.png "Logo Title Text 1")

in the "Source Code management" tab to "*/step3".
