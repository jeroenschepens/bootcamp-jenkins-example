It would be silly to let you do a Jenkins Bootcamp without the software we are going to use mainly... Below are instructions to download Jenkins, additional software and to set up your GitHub Account.

In this Chapter we will discuss the following topics:

- Installation of Jenkins
- additional Software needed for the bootcamp
- set up a GitHub account and fork the bootcamp example

***

## Jenkins

### first run

[../Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

After Jenkins has been installed in will open default on "http://localhost:8080"

### change port

[../Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

If you don't want jenkins to run on 8080 or if another service you use runs on that port you can change it:

- find Jenkins.xml (in the install directory you choose in the wizard)
- search for "--httpPort=8080".
- replace 8080 with the desired port number
- restart jenkins (http://localhost:8080/safeRestart)
- alternatively you can start java on another port using "java -jar jenkins.war -httpPort=8081" (or any other port)

### next up?

[../Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

You can continue [Configuring Jenkins](/docs/Config.md) and continue installing the additional software later. or continue installing the software doing the configuration later.
